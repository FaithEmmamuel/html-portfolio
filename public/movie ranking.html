        <h1>MY BEST MOVIES SINCE JANAURY</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 best movies of all time!</h2>

        <hr />

        <h3>Extraction 2</h3>
        <p>why i love this movie is because of the action in it, and how the lead actor handled every scene.</p>

        <h3>Praise This</h3>
        <p>This is my second best because, the Chloe Bailey has been one of my favorite. and the movie also teaches us 
            that God can use us at anytime to bless his people and also Music is therapetic.</p>

        <h3>The man called OTTO</h3>
        <p>It's a really good movie that shows or express how humans should treat others, because a lot of people 
           are going through a lot which they can't talk about, and with treating them right we could help fix what was broken.</p>
