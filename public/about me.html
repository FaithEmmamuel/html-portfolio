<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    My name is Faith Emmanuel, i am a native of okobo
     local government area in akwa ibom state, nigeria.
</p>

 <p>Learning web development has always been one of my greatest 
     dreams. and learning it right now is indeed a dream come true.
     who would have thought that after all these years i would actually 
     pick interest in learning. because at some point i almost gave up on
     learning or even having the thought to further my education. but with 
     the help of my friends and my aunty, i was able to pursue this dream.
</p>

<p>
    I graduated from UNIVERSITY OF CALABAR, CALABAR, CROSS RIVER STATE, NIGERIA.
    I studied electronics and computer technology which was at that time merged with 
    departement of physics. Now you see why i picked interesting in learning web development
    but the school i went to killed my love for it, instead i delved into doing something i loved
    doing or should i say love doing because i still have interest in it. and that is HAIR MAKING. 
    
</p>

<p>Making people's hair is one skill i never regret acquiring because it came through for me in different occasions
    this was my source of income back then in school. And now learning WEb Dev is one of my greatest happiness.
